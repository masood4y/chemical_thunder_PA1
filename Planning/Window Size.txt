This file is for the process of determining the window size and packet size of the Sender



Packet size (including TCP header): should be set to a default value. (have to figure out what that is)
Max Segment size should be set during Connection set up
Should only change when receiver is accepting less bytes than.


Window Size: Should be set to 1, add constant everytime it works right, divide by 2 everytime theres a timeout
Max window size should be significantly less than max sequence size to prevent miscommunication:
proposal: Max window size = Max_Seq# / 2 



after all packets Acknowledgement, set a flag or something
