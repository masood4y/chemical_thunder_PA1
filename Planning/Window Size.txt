This file is for the process of determining the window size and packet size of the Sender



Packet size (including TCP header): should be set to a default value. (have to figure out what that is)
Max Segment size should be set during Connection set up
Should only change when receiver is accepting less bytes than.


Window Size: Should be set to 1, add constant everytime it works right, divide by 2 everytime theres a timeout
Max window size should be significantly less than max sequence size to prevent miscommunication:
proposal: Max window size = Max_Seq# / 2 



after all packets Acknowledgement, set a flag or something




Sender Packet Size:
    1500 (or something else maybe) bytes of data, 
    if current window size less than 1500, packet size = current window size


Current Window Size Sender = Min(MaxSeq#/3, Cwnd calculation, writeRate) 

Max Window Size Sender and Receiver = Min(MaxSeq#/3, writeRate) 

Sender Window (in bytes of data):
    Acknowledged [10 + Current Window Size + 1 , 9]
    In Flight  [10, 10 + Current Window Size]
        - Add handling for end of Data

Receiver Window (in bytes of data):
    Received [10 + Max Window Size + 1, 9]
    Anticipate Next [10, 10 + Max Window Size]



Sender Packet size (in bytes of data):




2 bytes (short unsigned int)

[0, 2^16 - 1]
