(timer time, window size, packet size, rtt calculation, writing to file; all determined asynchronously)

- Connection Set up
- Data Exchange
- Connection Teardown



Connection Setup:
    Sender States:
        - Start Connection State: send SYNC bit = 1 (connection request) to dest port #, start timer, wait.
            if (timer end), go to Start Connection State. 
            else if (SYNC_ACK received), make window size based on writeRate, set up other details, goto: Send_N_Packets 

    Receiver States:
        - Wait_Connection: do nothing, wait for connection
            if (SYNC = 1 received), send SYNC_ACK = 1 and writeRate back to destination, go to state Wait_Start
            else, do nothing/wait. 
        - Wait_Start: do nothing/wait
            if (SYNC = 1 received), send SYNC_ACK = 1 and writeRate back to destination, go to state Wait_Start
            else if (SYNC = 0) received with data, add data to file, 




Data Exchange:
    Sender States:
        - Send_N_Packets: send all packets in window size available, start timer for first packet sent,
                goto: Wait_for_ACK

        - Wait_for_ACK: do nothing/wait
            if (ACK_Valid_received (its a proper Acknowledgement for valid seq#)), update window size, adjust Sliding Window,
                goto: Send_N_Packets
            else if (timeout), goto: Send_N_Packets.
            // else if (no more data flag), goto: 



    Receiver States:
        - Wait_for_Packet: do nothing/wait
            if (valid Seq packet) start small countdown-timer, adjust receive window, update Ack #, goto: Wait_for_Pipeline


        - Wait_for_Pipeline: do nothing/wait
            if (valid Seq packet), adjust receive window, update Ack #, goto: Wait_for_Pipeline
            if (small countdown timer), send Cumulative Acknowledgement, goto: Wait_for_Packet





Connection Teardown:
    Sender States:
        - Wait_FIN_Ack: if 

    Receiver States:
        - Fin_Wait_1 (after sending FIN bit = 1):
            - if data received, add it to file, stay in this state
            - else if ack 1 recieved, go to state
